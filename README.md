#  Computational Physics with VPython

This repository contains a collection of 3D physical simulations developed with **VPython**. The goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical physics and computational modeling.

##  Key Features
*   **3D Visualizations**: Real-time rendering of physical systems.
*   **Physical Models**: Simulations including planetary motion, damped oscillations, and rigid body dynamics.

##  Technologies
*   **Python**: Core programming language.
*   **VPython (GlowScript)**: For 3D graphics and vector animations.
